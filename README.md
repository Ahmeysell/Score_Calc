## Midterm Calculate

In this process, program wants you to enter your **Final Score** ::and then it calculates the minimum **Midterm Score** required to pass the course[^pass].

**This is midterm process in window**

## Final Calculate

The program will ask for your **Midterm Score** before calculating the minimal **Final Score** needed to pass the course[^pass].

**This is final process in window**

## Average Calculate

In this process, the program asks you for two entries, **final** and **midterm score**, and as a result tells you your **average** if you passed.

**This is average process in window**

[^pass]: Your average score must be at least 60 to pass the course
